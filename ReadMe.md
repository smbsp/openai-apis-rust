## Introduction to OpenAI and ChatGPT

### OpenAI and ChatGPT

OpenAI is a leading AI research organization dedicated to creating and promoting friendly AI for the benefit of humanity. One of their flagship products is ChatGPT, a powerful language model based on the GPT-4 architecture. ChatGPT-4o is a specialized version designed for operational efficiency and scalability in automated systems.

### OpenAI APIs

OpenAI provides a suite of APIs that enable developers to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications. These APIs offer access to various language models, including ChatGPT, for tasks such as text generation, conversation, summarization, and more.

### Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively guide AI models in generating desired outputs. It involves crafting prompts that are clear, concise, and contextually relevant to achieve optimal performance from language models like ChatGPT.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and learn like humans. AI encompasses a range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, which enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains two main projects:

### rust-openai-gpt4o-backend

- **Description**: This project includes the Rust code to interact with ChatGPT and create AI agents for developing backend systems as prompted in the command line.
- **Key Features**:
  - Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o API
  - Command-line interface for interacting with AI agents
  - Automated backend development tasks guided by AI

### rust-web-server-template

- **Description**: This project acts as a web server, utilizing file-based storage instead of databases.
- **Key Features**:
  - Basic web server setup using Rust
  - File-based storage for simplicity and ease of use
  - Integration with `rust-openai-gpt4o-backend` for AI-powered backend functionalities

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/smbsp/openai-apis-rust.git
    cd openai-apis-rust
    ```

2. **Install Rust**:
    Follow the instructions on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust.

3. **Install dependencies** for both projects:
    ```sh
    cd rust-openai-gpt4o-backend
    cargo build
    cd ../rust-web-server-template
    cargo build
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in both project directories and add the following variables:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    ```

## Usage

### rust-openai-gpt4o-backend

1. **Run the backend AI agent**:
    ```sh
    cd rust-openai-gpt4o-backend
    cargo run
    ```

2. **Interact with the AI agent**:
    Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the AI agent for backend development tasks.

### rust-web-server-template

1. **Run the web server**:
    ```sh
    cd rust-web-server-template
    cargo run
    ```

2. **Access the web server**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the web server.
